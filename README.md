# [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview)

## Overview
This repository contains materials related to the Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" where participants are tasked to predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.

## Description
The competition is ongoing with a rolling leaderboard. It is an ideal challenge for data scientists looking to enter the world of Natural Language Processing. The dataset provided consists of 10,000 tweets that have been manually classified, making it manageable even for those without significant computing power. The work can be done in Kaggle Notebooks, a platform offering free Jupyter Notebooks without any setup required.

## Competition Description
*Twitter has become a critical communication tool during emergencies. However, distinguishing between tweets that signal real disasters and those that do not can be challenging, especially for machine learning models.*

In this competition, your goal is to build a model that makes this distinction. You'll be provided with a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand-classified.

**Note:** The dataset may contain language that is profane, vulgar, or offensive.


### Acknowledgments
The dataset was created by figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website.

## Evaluation
The submissions will be evaluated based on the F1 score, a balance between precision and recall.
